This is the stack implementation through linked list.
To run program simply navigate folder in terminal using cd and ls repeatedly.
To run type in terminal "make " without quotes.
Now execute by typing "./stack" and perform the operations.


TO run it manually type "gcc functions.c stack.c -o stack"
Now execute by typing "./stack" and perform the operations.
Thank You

Stack implementation using class.
Tried using templates.
To run the program just download the Stack directory.
Inside Stack/StackImplementationClass/
there will be a file StackImplementationClass...build that file.
using command such as
g++ StackImplementationClass -o StackImplementationClass
then run by
./StackImplementatonClass
